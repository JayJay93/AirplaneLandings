# A Bionomic Algorithm for the Aircraft Landing Problem
## Problem Setting
In this project we implemented a Bionomic Algorithm for the Aircraft Landing Problem in a seminar at TUM. The seminar was about Airport Operations Management. A relevant problem many airports face is to determine the landing sequence and scheduling of incoming airlanes on the available runways while satisfying separation time constraints due to air turbulences. This becomes especially challenging with increasing air traffic. In this project we only regard the static case where all airplanes are known beforehand.
