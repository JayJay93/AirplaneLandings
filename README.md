In this project we implemented a Bionomic Algorithm for the Aircraft Landing Problem for a seminar at TUM. The seminar was about Airport Operations Management and the Aircraft Landing Problem is a relevant problem, especially with increasing air traffic. In this project we only regard the static case where all airplanes are known beforehand.
